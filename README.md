# Git_Tests

This repository contains folders named

for each and every program you ever made. 

Inside the folder that has the name of 

your program, there is a text file

with a list of inputs that BASH is 

supposed to feed to your program.

Download the folder with the name

of your program and save it in a 

directory on your personal computer

with the pathway ~/Desktop/Tests/

Then apply the script file in the

directory from EPI/EPI/and it will

automatically generate a report file

in pathway ~/Desktop/Tests/name_of_program

go in the pathway in the above line 

and view the .results file with nvim.
